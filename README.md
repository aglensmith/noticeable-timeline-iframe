This repository shows how to embed a Noticeable Timeline in your own pages via an iframe.

## Hash-based routing

By default, an iframe is masking the browser's address bar to show a URL different than the actual URL of the web page being viewed. 
In other words, the URL in the browser's address bar is not the actual URL to the content.
                                          
Hash-based routing allows targeting each iframe page via a dedicated URL. 
It is supported via a small JavaScript code snippet to include on the page that embeds the Timeline.

Below is an example to open a specific page:
